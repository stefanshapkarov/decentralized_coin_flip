# Coin Flip client-side

This client-side application is made with Vue 3 composition api set up with vite, together with the ethers 6 library that allows interaction with smart contracts using javascript.

To setup the project first you need to run:
```bash
npm install
```

You have to setup a .env file with the deployed contract address as VITE_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS variable (In the contract folder README file you can find the Sepolia testnet contract address)

Then to run it as dev:

```bash
npm run dev
```
